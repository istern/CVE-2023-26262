## Summary
It is possible via the import languages functionality to upload and arbitrary file. This file could be a webshell that would allow for execution of code on the server.


## Step to reproduce

This vulnerability haven't been tested on previous versions of Sitecore, but earlier version might be vulnerable for the same technique.

## Remediation
The code for uploading the language files should validate files being uploaded and only allow for executable files like aspx,exe and more. Also language files should only be uploaded to a directory that doesn't allow code execution. A way of doing this is by addaing a block rule to the web.config like the below. Note this will block all request to the two files.

```xml
<rule name="BlockFileUpload" enabled="true" patternSyntax="Wildcard" stopProcessing="true">
    <match url="*" />
    <conditions logicalGrouping="MatchAny">
        <add input="{URL}" pattern="*sitecore/shell/Applications/Files/FileBrowser.aspx" />
        <add input="{URL}" pattern="*sitecore/shell/Applications/Dialogs/Upload/Upload2.aspx" />
    </conditions>
    <action type="CustomResponse" statusCode="404" statusReason="File or directory not found." statusDescription="The resource you are looking for might have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable." />
</rule>
